        <p id="hi">Hi!</p>
        <p>I am a Polish photographer based in Montreal,
          specialised in portrait photography.
          I graduated form Warsaw School of Photography in 2010 and from
          Cultural Studies at Warsaw University in 2012.
        <br><br>
           I am mostly interested in the issues of body,
           movement and femininity. My mission as a photographer is to
           create intimate and authentic connections and provide a safe space
           for people to freely express themselves through my images.
        <br><br>
           I have a broad perspective on visual culture, which
           I gathered traveling and doing creative projects for the last 5 years
           in Europe, North America and South America.
           My interest in portraiture is primarily anchored in the documentary
           work of Mary-Ellen Young and Diane Arbus, but I also take inspiration
           from the minimalist aesthetics of Rinko Kawauchi’s art and the otherworldly,
           campy ambient of Tsai Ming-liang’s movies.
        <br><br>
           Please contact me if you’re interested in a private photo shoot
           or a creative collaboration. Yes, I will travel for work.
